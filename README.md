# üìö Project Overview
The goal of this project is to compare the effectiveness of 5G technology in ground tracking applications with directional radar and dipole radar. Through simulation, we model the signal propagation and performance metrics such as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for each radar system. The comparison highlights the potential advantages of integrating massive MIMO, beamforming, and low-latency communication in 5G technology for enhanced tracking accuracy and efficiency.

**Key Objectives:**
- Model and simulate the performance of 5G technology for ground tracking.
- Compare 5G technology with directional radar and dipole radar in terms of SNR and tracking range.
- Use MATLAB and Python for radar system simulations.
- Explore the advantages of massive MIMO and beamforming in 5G systems.
